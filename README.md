This repo is for My python practice in DevOps Journey

## Compiler Vs Interpreter
### Compiler
- one time Translation     
- preparation after translation 
- Independent Preparation/ Execution 
- if Errors, No Translation   

### Interpreter
- 'N' time Translation
- preparation while translation 
- preparation with Help/ Execute in runtime Environment
- Partial Preparation till Error

## Python is Hybrid
         
files.py  ---Compiler--->  python-byteCode  (files.pyc) ---Intermediate lang ---> PVM python virtual machine

## Python is platform Independent
Python is a platform-independent programming language. This means you can write Python code on one operating system (like Windows) and run it on another (like macOS or Linux) without any modifications to the code itself. This is because Python uses a Python Virtual Machine (PVM) to interpret and execute the code, which handles platform-specific details. 

## Programming paradigms 
- Procedural Programming 
- Object oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Modular Programming
